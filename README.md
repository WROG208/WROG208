- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WROG208
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in GMRS and Ham Radio, computers, and video games.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have been a truck driver for 25 years. The biggest load I ever moved was 182 feet long and weighed 538965 pounds. It was going to California and was picked up South of Dallas,TX. Took 4 weeks to travel what normaly
- would have taken less than a week because of problems with state permits and routes not being wide or tall enough for the load, which was a power plant generator.
